# Product Architecture Coach

中文名：产品架构教练

## Purpose

Turn a promising course/product direction into a clear product architecture that can be built, delivered, priced, and handed off to experience design, handout writing, or detail-page design.

This skill sits between opportunity judgment and downstream production:

```text
$product-opportunity-coach -> $product-architecture-coach -> $product-experience-coach / $product-detail-page-design / $personal-guide-writer
```

Use it to answer: "这个课程/训练营/知识产品到底怎么交付，用户每一步得到什么，核心承诺怎么落到真实机制，我需要准备哪些原材料，MVP 先做哪一版？"

## Boundaries

Use `$product-opportunity-coach` first when the question is whether an idea is worth doing, who will buy, or how to validate demand.

Use this skill when the opportunity or broad direction already exists and the user needs the product structure.

Use `$product-experience-coach` after this skill when the user needs onboarding, journey, emotion curve, service blueprint, retention, or peak-end design.

Use `$product-detail-page-design` after this skill when the user needs a sales page, detail page, landing-page copy, or multi-image product page.

Use `$personal-guide-writer` after this skill when the user needs a long, experience-based guide. Full lesson scripts, worksheets, and detailed course handouts require a separately chosen tool or explicit writing task; this bundle does not include `$course-handout-writing-coach`.

Do not use this skill to:

- decide a vague idea is worth building without user, scene, substitute, and validation evidence
- write a finished sales page
- write full lesson handouts
- design only visual UI
- inflate an unfinished product with fake proof, fake scarcity, fake testimonials, or fabricated screenshots

## Core Model

Use this formula:

```text
产品架构 = 真实需求 x 产品承诺 x 交付路径 x 原材料 x 加工方式 x 可见成果 x 反馈机制 x 定价逻辑
```

For knowledge products, classify the demand shape before designing the architecture:

- **结果型**: users want a measurable result. Design stages with method/SOP, tools, tasks, visible deliverables, and feedback.
- **过程型**: users want companionship, momentum, atmosphere, identity, or accountability. Design mission, short-term goals, rules, cadence, feedback, and community/service rituals.
- **混合型**: name both the result and the process. Do not promise a result while delivering only content, and do not sell companionship without a feedback loop.

For course and knowledge-product offers, absorb the useful part of "课程定位/Offer 架构" here:

- **Big Idea / 核心转变**: the memorable idea behind the product, grounded in the user's real positioning.
- **Quantifiable or visible outcome**: a measurable result when possible; otherwise a concrete artifact, system, behavior, or decision the user can own.
- **Unique mechanism**: the real delivery mechanism that creates the outcome, such as workflow, template, AI agent, feedback loop, case library, rubric, or cohort cadence.
- **Rights/bonuses**: only include bonuses that reduce friction or increase completion; do not pile on gifts to fake value.
- **Risk reducer**: diagnosis, trial, transparent presale terms, refund rule, sample lesson, low-ticket entry, or clear non-fit boundary.
- **Awareness fit**: if the buyer has low awareness or low trust, architecture should include education, diagnosis, or entry product before a high-commitment offer.

## Required Context

Before substantial product-architecture work, establish:

- the concrete product, course, service, template, or agent being designed
- the target user, current problem state, desired state, product form, and maturity when known
- the live commercial-positioning and product records resolved through the runtime
- user-supplied pages, outlines, notes, transcripts, prompts, or source files
- an existing upstream report from `$product-opportunity-coach`, if the opportunity was already evaluated

Read these references as needed:

- `references/product-architecture-blueprint.md`: final blueprint fields and quality gate.
- `references/course-structure.md`: course/training-camp path, stage, lesson, and title design rules.
- `references/material-processing.md`: active source search, raw material collection, teardown, migration, combination, and MVP scoping.
- `references/handoff.md`: handoff contracts to opportunity, experience, sales-page, and handout-writing work.

## AI Life System Runtime Contract

Use `$ai-life-system-init` as the structure-resolution layer before reading the user's Notion system.

1. Check runtime status first.
2. Resolve these concepts for every formal run:
   - `commercial_positioning`
   - `product`
3. Resolve other concepts only when the current product requires them:
   - user evidence: `user_profile`, `user_feedback`, `client_communication`
   - comparison: `benchmark_product`
   - knowledge and raw material: `note`, `information`, `book`, `course`, `question`
   - existing product assets: `ai_agent`, `ai_toolbox`
4. Runtime bindings locate the structure; current cloud Notion records and page bodies are the source of truth.
5. Do not depend on local Notion Sync, a local database index, personal filesystem paths, or fixed Notion page/database IDs.
6. A Relation means "possibly relevant", not "read everything". Inspect titles, descriptions, summaries, dates, and relation context first; fetch only records likely to change the architecture decision.
7. If the runtime is unavailable, continue only from materials explicitly supplied by the user, disclose the reduced evidence coverage, and never invent a local or fixed-ID fallback.
8. If an existing Notion record already answers a question, do not ask the user to repeat it. Ask only when the product object is ambiguous, evidence conflicts, or the missing answer would materially change the architecture.

## Notion Behavior

This skill is read-only toward Notion. It may read cloud records through the runtime, but it must not create, update, archive, or append to Notion pages. Its final deliverable is a product architecture blueprint for the user to review and adjust manually.

## Workflow

1. Define the architecture object.
   - Name the course/product.
   - Identify target user, current state, desired state, product type, and current maturity.
   - If this is not clear, ask for the smallest concrete version: "谁，在什么场景下，用什么产品，想走到什么结果？"

2. Anchor to positioning and evidence.
   - Resolve and read the live `commercial_positioning` and target `product` records first.
   - Use the user's positioning, product evidence, and supplied materials before generic product theory.
   - Separate `已验证证据`, `合理推断`, and `待验证假设`.
   - Do not invent user pain, conversion data, testimonials, product maturity, or market proof.
   - Read user profiles, feedback, client communication, benchmark products, and knowledge materials only when they can change the current architecture decision.
   - Record which source concepts were actually resolved and read, which were sampled, and which were unavailable.

3. Clarify the product promise.
   - Write one sentence: "帮助【某类人】从【问题状态】走到【目标状态】。"
   - Name the promise boundary: what the product can help users do, and what it does not promise.
   - If using an "独特机制", make it a real delivery mechanism, not a slogan.
   - Add an Offer blueprint when useful: Big Idea, visible outcome, unique mechanism, rights/bonuses, risk reducer, awareness fit, and proof needed.

4. Classify the demand and product form.
   - Decide whether the product is result-oriented, process-oriented, or hybrid.
   - Choose the primary form: course, training camp, template, toolkit, AI agent, consulting, community, service, or hybrid.
   - Check whether the form can actually deliver the promise.

5. Build the product path.
   - Design 3-5 stages that represent real user transformation points.
   - For each stage, define the stage goal, user obstacle, lesson/module, task, tool/template, deliverable, and feedback method.
   - Avoid vague stages like "基础认知" unless the user visibly needs that cognitive shift.

6. Design the course/product architecture.
   - For courses and training camps, use `references/course-structure.md`.
   - Each lesson should answer one user question, remove one obstacle, or create one deliverable.
   - Lesson titles should be short, concrete, result-oriented, and in user language.

7. Search, map, and process raw materials.
   - Use `references/material-processing.md`.
   - Search current cloud records and user-supplied materials before deciding the architecture when the product needs real substance.
   - List available materials: notes, cases, screenshots, tools, templates, prompts, workflows, user questions, personal experience, benchmark products, paid-course notes, and source transcripts.
   - Apply `拆迁法 = 拆解 + 迁移`: break strong external/internal materials into mechanisms, then adapt the mechanism into this product's target user, promise, and delivery path.
   - Apply `收租法 = 收集 + 组合`: collect related assets from one useful node, then combine them into a module, SOP, template, assignment, case library, or feedback rubric.
   - Decide how to process them: teardown, migration, collection, combination, simplification, templating, SOP extraction, task design, demonstration, or feedback design.
   - Mark missing materials that block delivery.

8. Scope the MVP.
   - Define what must exist for version 0.1 to be useful.
   - Separate `must-have`, `next`, and `later`.
   - Prefer a deliverable MVP over a complete-looking but untestable course.

9. Price and sales-page handoff.
   - Define pricing logic only at the architecture level: value anchor, delivery intensity, comparable alternatives, and pricing ladder hypothesis.
   - Connect price to Offer architecture: outcome value, delivery intensity, support level, proof, buyer awareness, and risk reducer.
   - Do not fabricate proof to support price.
   - Prepare the sales-page handoff: value point, solution, payment reason, proof available, missing proof, and claims that need careful wording.

10. Output the blueprint.
   - Use `references/product-architecture-blueprint.md`.
   - End with the next recommended downstream step: opportunity validation, experience design, handout writing, sales-page design, or user interview.
   - Do not write the result back to Notion.

## Quality Gates

Before final output, ensure:

1. **Positioning gate**: the architecture matches the user's current public positioning and does not drift into unrelated influencer/IP/business-coach language.
2. **Demand gate**: demand type is named and delivery matches it.
3. **Promise gate**: the product promise is specific, credible, and bounded.
4. **Path gate**: stages describe real transformation points, not a table of contents disguised as progress.
5. **Deliverable gate**: every core stage has a user action and visible deliverable.
6. **Feedback gate**: if the product claims "陪跑" or "训练营", it includes feedback cadence and provider-side effort.
7. **Material gate**: available and missing raw materials are explicit.
8. **MVP gate**: v0.1 is small enough to build and real enough to test.
9. **Integrity gate**: no fake proof, fake scarcity, exaggerated outcomes, or unfinished work presented as finished.
10. **Handoff gate**: the next skill or next action is clear.
11. **Offer gate**: the core promise, unique mechanism, risk reducer, and buyer awareness fit are clear enough to support downstream sales-page writing.
12. **Source gate**: the blueprint states which cloud concepts and user-supplied materials were actually used, what was only sampled, and what evidence remains unavailable.

## Output Standard

For formal runs, return:

- `一句话结论`
- `产品对象与定位边界`
- `读取来源与覆盖边界`
- `证据与假设`
- `目标用户与需求形态`
- `核心承诺与非承诺`
- `Offer 蓝图：Big Idea / 独特机制 / 权益赠品 / 风险降低 / 认知水平`
- `产品形态建议`
- `产品路径`
- `课程/模块架构`
- `任务 -> 方法/SOP -> 工具 -> 交付物 -> 反馈`
- `原材料清单与加工方式`
- `原材料地图：来源 / 可拆解内容 / 可迁移机制 / 可加工产物 / 使用边界`
- `MVP 版本`
- `定价逻辑与销售页交接`
- `最大架构风险`
- `下一步`

The output is a reviewable blueprint, not a Notion mutation log. Do not add a writeback confirmation, created-page URL, or database-update section.

For quick questions, answer with the architecture decision, the biggest overlap/risk, and the next concrete design action.

## Style

Use Chinese by default.

Be concrete and product-minded. Prefer "用户完成什么、交出什么、得到什么反馈" over abstract educational language.

Use the product language found in the live positioning and product records. Do not impose a fixed public category, branded system name, or AI-product vocabulary that the user has not chosen.

Avoid high-pressure guru language, fake certainty, and "教你暴富" style claims. Let the product win through clear transformation, real materials, visible deliverables, and honest proof.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask one concise question if:

- there is no concrete course/product/service/template/agent to architect
- more than one same-name or plausible product record exists and the target cannot be resolved safely
- the target user is completely unknown and the architecture would change by user type
- required source files named by the user cannot be read
- the user asks for market-current claims that require web verification but browsing is unavailable
