# Article Source Preflight

Run this before any cloud Notion retrieval for a full article. It preserves the source-preflight step while using `$ai-life-system-init` as the only structural foundation.

## Runtime Contract

1. From the `$ai-life-system-init` root, run `python3 scripts/runtime.py --config-dir ~/.commercial-system status`.
2. If status is `needs_init`, stop Notion retrieval and ask the user to initialize or rebind. Do not fall back to fixed IDs, local Notion Sync, or a copied database list.
3. Resolve each required concept with `python3 scripts/runtime.py --config-dir ~/.commercial-system resolve --concept <key>`.
4. `ready`: record the unique target and continue only if `read_ready: true`.
5. `multiple`: filter using the current article object and user context; if that still changes truthfulness, ask the user.
6. `not_found`: search cloud Notion by the user-provided title or link when one exists. Otherwise record the source as unavailable; absence from the index is not proof that the template lacks the capability.
7. Fetch the resolved cloud object before querying its records and confirm its title/Data Source identity matches the Runtime target.

## Stable Concepts

Resolve only the concepts required for the current article:

- always from the commercial workspace when present: `commercial_positioning`, `content`; `benchmark_content` only when benchmark analysis affects the article
- reader and commercial evidence when relevant: `user_profile`, `user_feedback`, `client_communication`, `product`, `account`
- user-provided or separately authorized knowledge support when relevant: personal scenes, writing samples, books, articles and other evidence. These are not required databases in the commercial workspace.

Relation means “possibly relevant”, not “read every related page”. Inspect titles, properties, summaries, and dates first; fetch only records likely to change the current article.

## Working Summary

来源预检：
- Runtime 状态：

```

Blocking failures stop drafting when they affect a required first-person scene, core positioning, duplicate detection, account-specific style review, or a strong factual claim. A non-blocking failure must still narrow claims or produce a short source warning.

## Forbidden Fallbacks

- local Notion Sync or Markdown mirrors
- local database indexes other than the `$ai-life-system-init` Runtime
- freshness fields such as `notion_synced_at`
- fixed database IDs, Data Source IDs, URLs, or personal paths
- guessing that a database container title is also the Data Source title
